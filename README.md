# Predict-Breast-Cancer-
This repository is for the final project of the STA 223 class in Winter 2020 at UC Davis. 
Based on the fit logistic regression with model, we applied the likleihood method and a Bootstrap method to obtain confidence intervals for several parameters of interest.
As an experiment, we also fit the logistic regression models with either L1 or L2 penalties to see the predictive performance of the logistic regression model.
For more details, see the final report pdf.
